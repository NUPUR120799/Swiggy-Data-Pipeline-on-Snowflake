# Swiggy-Data-Pipeline-on-Snowflake

Built an end-to-end data warehousing pipeline on Snowflake using Swiggy’s OLTP data. Ingested multiple CSV datasets (customers, restaurants, orders, menu, delivery) into the staging layer, performed data cleansing and transformation in the clean layer, and modeled Fact-Dimension tables in the consumption layer following Star/Snowflake schema. Implemented Streams for delta data tracking and incremental loading. Strengthened understanding of 3-layer data warehouse architecture, ETL/ELT design, and OLTP-to-OLAP model conversion for scalable analytics.
